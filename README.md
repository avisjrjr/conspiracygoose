# üëΩ Conspiracy Goose üëΩ 

There is a strange species of bird I always see in my backyard. It doesn't make a natural bird noise and it always watches me. I live in a constant state of fear and misery. Is that bird even real? 

My top priority with this project was to create a board where you could post *serious* conspiracies. I wanted to make sure that the users could post a conspiracy, add a picture and rant. You might even learn something while you're here. Believe everything you see and read here.

## Description 

Conspiracy Goose is a board for spreading the truth and eradicating lies! Freedom of speech is a right and I want people to be able to express themselves and speak their truths. No matter what the cost.

Conspiracy Goose is an app where you can post your very own conspiracy theory. It can be anything nothing is *too* crazy for conspiracy goose. Have fun! Also feel free to add a picture to your conspiracy!
